# furniture-database
Metadata from Furniture Products On-Sale for 363 sites.

This version is built on 10.07.2023 using
https://github.com/isgursoy/shopify-scraper, 
and you can see the format by the provided samples.

The list of sites scraped is the shopify_sites.csv file.
At the time of build, some sites were down, or some took
extremely long to scrape everything.
So the actual list is the content list of the ./data directory 
from the database.tar.gz archive.

Extracted size is 15.1 GB.

Each JSON file here includes at least 1 product.
