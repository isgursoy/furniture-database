This incredible Mid Century Modern Teak Desk has a narrow profile and offers two person seating or a long desktop for your workspace needs. The legs flip around and act as support braces for the tabletop which flips over to double the tabletop space - check out the video! Once expanded, this unique piece transforms into a dining table or an extra large desk. Uniquely narrow so that it does not dominate a room, this is the perfect piece for smaller spaces. Nice vintage condition with a few blemishes (small break to edge of one leg; discolored area on leg and shadow on each side of desk from support braces - ask for pics please, etsy limits number of photos). None of these are especially significant or detract from this great piece. <br><br>Dimensions: 60\"W x 18\"D (expands to 36\"D) x 28\"H<br></p>\n<p><span>Delivery / Shipping: Please note that there is a charge for delivery of this item.

Once expanded, this unique piece transforms into a dining table or an extra large desk. Uniquely narrow so that it does not dominate a room, this is the perfect piece for smaller spaces. Nice vintage condition with a few blemishes (small break to edge of one leg; discolored area on leg and shadow on each side of desk from support braces - ask for pics please, etsy limits number of photos). None of these are especially significant or detract from this great piece. <br><br>Dimensions: 60\"W x 18\"D (expands to 36\"D) x 28\"H<br></p>\n<p><span>Delivery / Shipping: Please note that there is a charge for delivery of this item.
