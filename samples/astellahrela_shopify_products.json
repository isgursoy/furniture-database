In the spirit of having some fun you could sometimes perceive that it could come at the expense of someone. The subject beneath the butterfly is arguably a good \u2018someone\u2019 being a quite aloof and arrogant Jean-Baptiste Colbert whom, despite having a large responsibility in helping ensure France\u2019s economic well-being for two centuries with the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale, Colbert was also the author of what became the Code Noir (1685). This decree gave legal sanction to a brutal system of torture and repression intended to enforce the institution of slavery in the French colonial empire, restricted the activities of free Blacks, made Roman Catholicism a compulsory religion, and ordered Jews to leave the colonies.
