The Widow Cliquot invented the rack and the method of turning champagne bottles on mass in her cellars to increase the production of her cellars over that of her rivals. It is still practiced in many champagne houses today, although in recent years there has been a move by the large commercial producers to mechanized rotation. An expert cellar worker, it is said, can turn as many as fifty thousand bottles in a day, and these skilled employees carry on the tradition when making vintage champagne in France. By the 1830s, winemakers throughout the Champagne turned to standing A-frame racks called pipitres. The word means \u201cdesk,\u201d but in fact they look like old-fashioned childhood easels. They can be found in cellars in any part of the world where sparkling wine is crafted. These hold 120 bottles<br></p>"}, {"Code": "", "Collection": "Clearance", "Category": "Dining Room Furniture", "Name": "RAT Sideboard", "Variant Name": "Natural", "Price": "1795.00", "In Stock": "Yes", "URL": "https://furnituresales.com.au/products/200573810", "Image URL": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0279/8216/8142/products/AtSzRY5zVJRA-kso0G_yM0jxk_1bd92b52-a99c-4f39-8d12-662d09ae8650.jpg?v=1574400373", "Body": "<p>Reclaimed Australian hardwood with a lime wash finish.</p>\n\n<p>This product is made locally from reclaimed Australian timber.

They are an outdoor fireplace which has a large, slightly raised firebox and a short smoke chimney that is used to draw the smoke away by creating a draft. The firebox itself is ball-shaped, and the chimney is about one to one and a half times the height of the firebox.The advantage of this Chiminea outdoor fireplace is that the smoke stack makes the chiminea fireplace more efficient than fire pits and other outdoor fireplaces. The chiminea draws air in at the firebox level and drafts it up the chimney into the open air. This creates excellent air flow, feeding the fire so it burns hot and clean. That means a chiminea outdoor fireplace will produce less smoke.The ball-shaped firebox gives the chiminea two more advantages-size and safety. The firebox of the chiminea is plenty large to accommodate a lot of wood and to get a good fire going just as hot as you want it to be. Chiminea outdoor fireplaces are made from cast iron.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff2a00;\">\ufeffSOLD OUT! New stock available mid August.

The Widow Cliquot invented the rack and the method of turning champagne bottles on mass in her cellars to increase the production of her cellars over that of her rivals. It is still practiced in many champagne houses today, although in recent years there has been a move by the large commercial producers to mechanized rotation. An expert cellar worker, it is said, can turn as many as fifty thousand bottles in a day, and these skilled employees carry on the tradition when making vintage champagne in France. By the 1830s, winemakers throughout the Champagne turned to standing A-frame racks called pipitres. The word means \u201cdesk,\u201d but in fact they look like old-fashioned childhood easels. They can be found in cellars in any part of the world where sparkling wine is crafted. These hold 120 bottles<br></p>"}]}}
