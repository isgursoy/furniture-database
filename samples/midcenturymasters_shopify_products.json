In 1912, Romain left St. Petersburg for Paris at the age of nineteen with the aim of becoming an artist. After working with Paul \" Le Magnifique\" Poiret on several theatrical productions Romain, still under the pseudonym of Erte, began to work more independently.

His masterpieces for the stage included extravagant production designs at venues such as New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall, the Casino de Paris, and the Paris Opera. In 1915 he began his long professional relationship with Harper's Bazaar and created 240 covers for the esteemed magazine. For 6 months in 1916, Ert\u00e9 simultaneously worked with Vogue as well.

The \"Carimate\" chair is one of Vico Magistretti\u2019s most famous chairs. Magistretti created this chair for the 'Club House of Carimate's Golf Club' restaurant. The chairs changed to four different manufacturers until Magistretti requested a patent for the construction in 1963. The \"Carimate\" chair is inspired by the tradition of countryside furniture and simple materials such as straw and wood. Due to the architectural, open frame, the \"Carimate\" chair has an intense expression. The combination of traditional Italian craftsmanship and modernist design creates a timeless chair. Furniture, lamps, and other objects designed by Vico Magistretti (1920-2006) may be found worldwide. Magistretti's research has been continuous - into the design, the culture of the project, and innovative experimentation with materials and space solutions, not to mention shapes and functions far from the rigors of fashion they have passed through during the years. He started designing for Cassina in 1960, and from that date on, his signature will be found on many products.</span></p>\n<ul class=\"_9415d43e\">\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\">Dimensions</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\"><span data-tn=\"pdp-spec-detail-height\" class=\"_420ca3aa\"><span class=\"_e8d322f0\">Height: 29 in.

The \"Carimate\" chair is one of Vico Magistretti\u2019s most famous chairs. Magistretti created this chair for the 'Club House of Carimate's Golf Club' restaurant. The chairs changed to four different manufacturers until Magistretti requested a patent for the construction in 1963. The \"Carimate\" chair is inspired by the tradition of countryside furniture and simple materials such as straw and wood. Due to the architectural, open frame, the \"Carimate\" chair has an intense expression. The combination of traditional Italian craftsmanship and modernist design creates a timeless chair. Furniture, lamps, and other objects designed by Vico Magistretti (1920-2006) may be found worldwide. Magistretti's research has been continuous - into the design, the culture of the project, and innovative experimentation with materials and space solutions, not to mention shapes and functions far from the rigors of fashion they have passed through during the years. He started designing for Cassina in 1960, and from that date on, his signature will be found on many products.</span></p>\n<ul class=\"_9415d43e\">\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\">Dimensions</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\"><span data-tn=\"pdp-spec-detail-height\" class=\"_420ca3aa\"><span class=\"_e8d322f0\">Height: 29 in.

The \"Carimate\" chair is one of Vico Magistretti\u2019s most famous chairs. Magistretti created this chair for the 'Club House of Carimate's Golf Club' restaurant. The chairs changed to four different manufacturers until Magistretti requested a patent for the construction in 1963. The \"Carimate\" chair is inspired by the tradition of countryside furniture and simple materials such as straw and wood. Due to the architectural, open frame, the \"Carimate\" chair has an intense expression. The combination of traditional Italian craftsmanship and modernist design creates a timeless chair. Furniture, lamps, and other objects designed by Vico Magistretti (1920-2006) may be found worldwide. Magistretti's research has been continuous - into the design, the culture of the project, and innovative experimentation with materials and space solutions, not to mention shapes and functions far from the rigors of fashion they have passed through during the years. He started designing for Cassina in 1960, and from that date on, his signature will be found on many products.</span></p>\n<ul class=\"_9415d43e\">\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\">Dimensions</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"_e5947548\">\n<div data-tn=\"pdp-spec-title\" class=\"_8b867e52\"><span data-tn=\"pdp-spec-detail-height\" class=\"_420ca3aa\"><span class=\"_e8d322f0\">Height: 29 in.
